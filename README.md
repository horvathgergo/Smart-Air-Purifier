# Smart Air Purifier (Project Uppatvind)
Custom PCB based on ESP12-F (ESP8266) wifi module serves as a smart controller for IKEA Uppatvind Air Purifiers. It's embedded microcontroller enables you to incorporate your device to home automation systems (preferably to Home Assistant) or control it via custom mobile applications as it enjoys support from wide variety of firmwares. This project is going to be implemented in two simple major phases: Hardware and Software design. Hardware is designed with KiCAD, manufactured with assembly services by a reputable Chinese company. Software is planned to be based on MicroPython and ESPHome firmwares.
